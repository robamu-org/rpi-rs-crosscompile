# Cross-compiling an application for the Raspberry Pi requires a toolchain for the linker.
# Make sure to add the cross-compiler binary path to your system path and then
# set the "*-gcc" binary as the linker
# You can download a corss-compiler build with crosstool-ng from here for Unix systems:

# For Windows, it is recommended to get the the toolchain from SysProgs:

# If you use a different cross-compiler, adapt this flag accordinlgy.

# Requires Python3 installation. Takes care of transferring and running the application
# to the Raspberry Pi
runner = "py bld-deploy-rpi.py -t -r --source"

# Debug configurations

# '-d' will start a gdbserver session on port 2331 of the remote machine,
# '-s' will start the GDB application locally as well.
# This requires a gdbserver installation on the remote machine and a GDB application
# installation on the local machine

# Only start server.Use cargo run to start the gdbserver, and then launch
# a GDB application or VS Code with the CodeLLDB plugin to debug your application.
# runner = "py bld-deploy-rpi.py -t -d --source
# Start GDB application in command lime as well
